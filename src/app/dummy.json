Pain and Stiffness in Joints Different types of arthritis have different symptoms. In general, people with most forms of arthritis have pain and stiffness in their joints. Osteoarthritis usually develops slowly and can occur in any joint, but often occurs in weight-bearing joints. Early in the disease, joints may ache after physical work or exercise. Most often, osteoarthritis occurs in the hands, hips, knees, neck, or low back. Common Signs Common signs of osteoarthritis include - joint pain, swelling, and tenderness - stiffness after getting out of bed - a crunching feeling or sound of bone rubbing on bone. joint pain, swelling, and tenderness stiffness after getting out of bed a crunching feeling or sound of bone rubbing on bone. Not everyone with osteoarthritis feels pain, however. In fact, only a third of people with x-ray evidence of osteoarthritis report pain or other symptoms. Diagnosis To make a diagnosis of osteoarthritis, most doctors use a combination of methods and tests including a medical history, a physical examination, x-rays, and laboratory tests. - A medical history is the patient's description of symptoms and when and how they began. The description covers pain, stiffness, and joint function, and how these have changed over time. - A physical examination includes the doctor's examination of the joints, skin, reflexes, and muscle strength. The doctor observes the patient's ability to walk, bend, and carry out activities of daily living. - X-rays are limited in their capacity to reveal how much joint damage may have occurred in osteoarthritis. X-rays usually don't show osteoarthritis damage until there has been a significant loss of cartilage. A medical history is the patient's description of symptoms and when and how they began.

X-rays usually don't show osteoarthritis damage until there has been a significant loss of cartilage. Questions Your Doctor May Ask It is important for people with joint pain to give the doctor a complete medical history. Answering these questions will help your doctor make an accurate diagnosis: - Is the pain in one or more joints? - When does the pain occur and how long does it last? - When did you first notice the pain? - Does activity make the pain better or worse? - Have you had any illnesses or accidents that may account for the pain? - Is there a family history of any arthritis or rheumatic diseases? - What medicines are you taking? Is the pain in one or more joints? When does the pain occur and how long does it last? When did you first notice the pain? Does activity make the pain better or worse? Have you had any illnesses or accidents that may account for the pain? Is there a family history of any arthritis or rheumatic diseases? What medicines are you taking? A patient's attitudes, daily activities, and levels of anxiety or depression have a lot to do with how severe the symptoms of osteoarthritis may be. Who Can Provide Care Treating arthritis often requires a multidisciplinary or team approach. Many types of health professionals care for people with arthritis. You may choose a few or more of the following professionals to be part of your health care team. - Primary care physicians -- doctors who treat patients before they are referred to other specialists in the health care system.

You may feel pain in one area of your body, such as your back, abdomen or chest or you may feel pain all over, such as when your muscles ache from the flu. Pain can be helpful in diagnosing a problem. Without pain, you might seriously hurt yourself without knowing it, or you might not realize you have a medical problem that needs treatment. Once you take care of the problem, pain usually goes away. However, sometimes pain goes on for weeks, months or even years. This is called chronic pain. Sometimes chronic pain is due to an ongoing cause, such as cancer or arthritis. Sometimes the cause is unknown. Fortunately, there are many ways to treat pain. Treatment varies depending on the cause of pain. Pain relievers, acupuncture and sometimes surgery are helpful.

I was admitted in Ft Worth, Doctors were confused, their tests showed nothing, but they knew somethingwas bad wrong. I went to Cardiologists in Ft Worth, to Kidney Doctors, Endocrinologist Physicians, nobody could figure out what was happened to me. Anxiety was ruled out quickly, they all knew there was something wrong, but could not figure out what it was causing the life threatening Blood Pressure spikes. I was put on so many medications life saving meds used primarily in ER’s and on Ambulances, and for a year I was  unable to sleep waking up with BP at night in the 170’s 180’s amped up and unable to sleep even taking the BP Meds.\n\nI saw two great Doctors in Dallas, Dr Javier Sanchez MD and Dr Tamara Tamirisi MD, both worked hard to help me, and they did. A year after my Long Covid nighmare began they refererred me to the fine people at  Texas Cardiovascular, at Medical City Spine Heart Hospital. I was referred to a super good Doctor named Eric Eichhorn MD FACC He got me in to see him in a week. I was so impressed at the kindness and concern all of the staff at Texas Cardiovascular showed me. His PA, Nurse, all of the office staff, everybody cared.\n\nWhen Dr Eichhorn came in the room I was sitting on the table and he sat down, smiled, introduced himself, and asked me “Do you feel unbalanced?” I said yes, he helped me up and did a couple tests on me, diagnosed immediately Ataxia and ordered testing, he stayed with me along with PA who was taking notes. He spike to me kindly, with compassion and empathy, he showed me he cared, and he promised me he would not stop looking until he had a diagnosis for my problems. He ordered a lot of tests to be done, had a plan to help me.\n\nI felt so comfortable with him, so at ease, and so cared for, he wanted to help me get well, whatever it took. All I can say is that you very rarely find a “Doctor” like Eric Eichhorn who will keep going until he has an answer. I am so impressed with this Doctor, his PA gave me a hug for everything I have been through, and they assured me, they would not quit looking until they had the answers to make me better.

I was admitted in Ft Worth, Doctors were confused, their tests showed nothing, but they knew somethingwas bad wrong. I went to Cardiologists in Ft Worth, to Kidney Doctors, Endocrinologist Physicians, nobody could figure out what was happened to me. Anxiety was ruled out quickly, they all knew there was something wrong, but could not figure out what it was causing the life threatening Blood Pressure spikes. I was put on so many medications life saving meds used primarily in ER’s and on Ambulances, and for a year I was  unable to sleep waking up with BP at night in the 170’s 180’s amped up and unable to sleep even taking the BP Meds.\n\nI saw two great Doctors in Dallas, Dr Javier Sanchez MD and Dr Tamara Tamirisi MD, both worked hard to help me, and they did. A year after my Long Covid nighmare began they refererred me to the fine people at  Texas Cardiovascular, at Medical City Spine Heart Hospital. I was referred to a super good Doctor named Eric Eichhorn MD FACC He got me in to see him in a week. I was so impressed at the kindness and concern all of the staff at Texas Cardiovascular showed me. His PA, Nurse, all of the office staff, everybody cared.\n\nWhen Dr Eichhorn came in the room I was sitting on the table and he sat down, smiled, introduced himself, and asked me “Do you feel unbalanced?” I said yes, he helped me up and did a couple tests on me, diagnosed immediately Ataxia and ordered testing, he stayed with me along with PA who was taking notes. He spike to me kindly, with compassion and empathy, he showed me he cared, and he promised me he would not stop looking until he had a diagnosis for my problems. He ordered a lot of tests to be done, had a plan to help me.\n\nI felt so comfortable with him, so at ease, and so cared for, he wanted to help me get well, whatever it took. All I can say is that you very rarely find a “Doctor” like Eric Eichhorn who will keep going until he has an answer. I am so impressed with this Doctor, his PA gave me a hug for everything I have been through, and they assured me, they would not quit looking until they had the answers to make me better. I am 61 years old and have never been to a Doctor Group like Texas Cardiovascular Specialists who put me at the top of the “Lets Get Him Well” list.\n\nTo Dr Eichhorn, and all of his staff “Thank You”  for caring and working to give me back a quality of life.
